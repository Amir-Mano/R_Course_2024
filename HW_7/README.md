# Specific README file within HW_7
### This is an additional README file, for the purpose of HW_8

In HW_7 I created from 30 CSV files:
  1. raw data table
  2. filtered data table
Then I used descriptive statistics to describe the data, and visualize it.

The visualization of the stroop statistics is shown here:
